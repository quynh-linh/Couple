            Since the 1920s, Hitler had seen Russia, with its immense natural resources, as the principal target for
            conquest and expansion. It would provide, he believed, the necessary ‘Lebensraum’, or living space, for the
            German people. And by conquering Russia, Hitler would also destroy the “Jewish pestilential creed of
            Bolshevism”. His non-aggression pact with Stalin in August 1939 he regarded as a mere temporary expedient.
            <br />
            Barely a month after the fall of France, and while the Battle of Britain was being fought, Hitler started
            planning for the Blitzkrieg campaign against Russia, which began on 22 June 1941. Despite repeated warnings,
            Stalin was taken by surprise, and for the first few months the Germans achieved spectacular victories,
            capturing huge swathes of land and hundreds of thousands of prisoners. But they failed to take Moscow or
            Leningrad before winter set in.

            On 5/6 December, the Red Army launched a counter-offensive which removed the immediate threat to the Soviet
            capital. It also brought the German high command to the brink of a catastrophic military crisis. Hitler
            stepped in and took personal command. His intervention was decisive and he later boasted, “That we overcame
            this winter and are today in a position again to proceed victoriously… is solely attributable to the bravery
            of the soldiers at the front and my firm will to hold out…”
